# Unity-LuxChess

Developed during cold days in 2015 :)<br>
Entirely written from scratch in C# for unity3D.<br>
It features chess AI based on ALPHA-BETA pruning and fast performance using BITBOARDS.<br>

<br>
<br>
NOTE: that <b>ONGUI</b> was deprecated in unity 2018, for this reason demo scene will not work properly. This is known bug and Ill update demo scene soon.
